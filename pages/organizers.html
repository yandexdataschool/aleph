<h2>The biographies of the organizers</h2>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong>Thomas Blake</strong> received his PhD in experimental high energy physics from Imperial College London, UK, in 2008. After completing his PhD, he held postdoctoral research positions with Imperial College and CERN. Since 2014, he has held a Royal Society research fellowship based at the University of Warwick on the LHCb experiment. He is currently co-convener of the LHCb working group searching for rare and forbidden decays.</p>

<p><strong>Marc-Olivier</strong> Bettler received his PhD in experimental particle physics from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2010, after which he held different postdoctoral research Fellowships with INFN at Florence, with SNSF and Marie-Curie working at Cambridge. Since 2015, he held a CERN research Fellowship working on the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. He was convener of the Very Rare Decays
from 2013 to 2015 and currently is convener of the Rare Decays working
group at LHCb.</p>

<p><strong>Marcin Chrząszcz</strong> is a postdoctoral researcher at University of Zurich and Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Science. He is part of the LHCb and BaBar experiments and contributes to the HFAG and GAMBIT collaborations. During his career he received SCIEX scholarship and Diamond Grand. He was one of the main authors of the τ→μμμ analysis in LHCb.</p>

<p><strong>Francesco Dettori</strong> received his PhD in Physics from Universita’ degli Studi di Cagliari, Italy. Has been post-doc at Nikhef, Amsterdam and is currently a Research Fellow at CERN.
Working in the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, he is currently convener of the Very Rare Decays group and deputy project leader of the Outer Tracker, one of the sub-detectors of the same experiment.</p>

<p><strong>Pavel Serdyukov</strong> is the Head of Research Projects at Yandex, where he manages a team of researchers working in the field of web search, data mining, computer vision and others. He co-organized a number of workshops at SIGIR, was a co-organizer of the Entity track at TREC 2009-2011, and co-organized a series of WSDM workshops around machine learning challenges related to web page relevance prediction, search engine switching detection and web personalization  in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. He has also published extensively in top-tier conferences on the topics related to web search and has served as a senior PC member at most recent WWW, WSDM and CIKM conferences and was also the General Chair of ECIR 2013 in Moscow. Before joining Yandex in 2011, he was a postdoc at Delft University, got his PhD from Twente University (2009) and his MSc from Max-Planck Institute for Computer Science (2005).</p>

<p><strong>Andrey Ustyuzhanin</strong> is the Head of CERN Projects at Yandex, Andrey is responsible for managing the company’s partnership with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), he is member of the CERN openlab board of sponsors and he supervises the development of several projects Yandex does at LHCb: LHCb EventIndex and EventFilter systems as well as collaborative software infrastructure for computational experiments – Reproducible Experiment Platform. He also oversees the company’s joint research projects and Data Science education programmes.
Now he is also the head of academic group at Yandex Data Factory department (<a href="http://yandexdatafactory.com">http://yandexdatafactory.com</a>) and he contributes to the LHCb collaboration of CERN from both Russia's National Research Centre "Kurchatov Institute" and Yandex School of Data Analysis (YSDA), which has joined LHCb experiment in December 2014.
In summer 2015 he took leading part in organization of the summer school on Machine Learning for High Energy Physics (<a href="http://www.hse.ru/mlhep2015/">http://www.hse.ru/mlhep2015/</a>). He is very much interested in development of new area of Machine Learning for fundamental sciences and for Experimental Physics in particular. He holds position of visiting researcher at Imperial College London.
Andrey has received PhD degree in Computer Science from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and he holds position of Associate Professor there.</p>
