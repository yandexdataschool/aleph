Title: Schedule


<h3>11th of December, 2015</h3>
The tentative schedule of our proposed workshop is as follows. It might be revised depending on the number and quality of accepted papers and whether we have other invited speakers. In particular, we may add one or two contributed talks conditioned on the quality of the submissions, and make the invited talks and related discussions slightly shorter. We also plan to invite a number of participants of our challenge with non-trivial solutions to participate in our poster session.

        <td><b>Open Machine Learning Problems in High Energy Physics</b>
        <p>Machine Learning tools have revolutionized data analysis in high-energy physics (HEP). But the problems posed by HEP are unique in many aspects, presenting novel challenges and requiring novel solutions. I will describe recent progress in tackling these open problems and describe current outstanding issues.</p>

        <p>In recent years, our deep artificial neural networks (including recurrent ones) have won numerous contests in pattern recognition and machine learning. They are now widely used in industry. I will briefly review deep supervised / unsupervised / reinforcement learning, and discuss the latest state of the art results in numerous applications.
