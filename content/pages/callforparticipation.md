Title: Call for Participation

Our primary goal is to bring the Physics and ML communities together to initiate discussions on Physics-motivated problems and applications in ML. It is not unknown that the ML community is still largely untouched by the numerous learning challenges coming from Physics. We hope that as a result of this workshop (as well as a result of the "Flavours of Physics" challenge organized before the workshop and the new dataset that we shared in its scope that are to be discussed at the workshop), these problems will attract more attention from ML researchers.

We encourage the participants of the ["Flavours of Physics"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/) challenge to participate in the workshop and report about their experiences in this challenge, their solutions and recommendations for the future competitions. In order to participate as a speaker or with a poster, you need to submit a proposal. When describing your approach, please, focus on its aspects that make it most unique w.r.t. other/standard approaches, in your opinion.

The proposal should be around 500-1000 words. 

It should be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aleph2015) by 26th of October. 

The notifications of speaker/poster proposal acceptance will be due on 2nd of November. We are aware, that Canadian visa preparation sometimes takes too long, so we will make sure that good submissions get accepted earlier.

The best solution supplemented with a speaker/poster proposal will be awarded a special Physics prize, which includes $2000 USD. The award committee consists of physicists of CERN LHCb collaboration: Marc-Olivier Bettler (CERN), Marcin ChrzÄ…szcz (Zurich University), Francisco Dettori (CERN), Thomas Blake (Warwick University).

Please, note we are looking forward to see you at our workshop at NIPS even even if you would not get a speaker/poster slot.
