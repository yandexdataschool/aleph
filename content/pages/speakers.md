### Jürgen Schmidhuber (IDSIA)

<p>
Since age 15 or so, the main scientific ambition of professor <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen>J&uuml;rgen Schmidhuber</A> (pronounce: <em>You_again Shmidhoobuh</em>) has been to build a <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/optimalscientist.html>self-improving</A> <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/ai.html>Artificial Intelligence</A> (AI) smarter than himself, then retire. He has pioneered <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearner.html>self-improving general problem solvers</A> since 1987, and <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/deeplearning.html>Deep Learning Neural Networks (NNs)</A> since <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/firstdeeplearner.html>1991</A>. The <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/rnn.html>recurrent NNs (RNNs)</A> developed by his research groups at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA & USI & SUPSI & TU Munich were the first RNNs to win official international contests. They have revolutionized <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html>connected handwriting recognition</A>, speech recognition, machine translation, optical character recognition, image caption generation, and are now in use at Google, Microsoft, IBM, Baidu, and many other companies. Founders & staff of DeepMind (sold to Google for over 600M) include 4 former PhD students from his lab. His team's <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-overview.html>Deep Learners</A> were <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/deeplearningwinsMICCAIgrandchallenge.html>the first to win object detection</A> and <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/deeplearningwinsbraincontest.html>image segmentation contests</A>, and achieved the world's first <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html>superhuman visual classification</A> results, winning <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/deeplearning.html>nine international competitions</A> in machine learning & pattern recognition (more than any other team). They also were the first to learn control policies
<A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/compressednetworksearch.html>
directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning.</A>
His research group also established the field of <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/unilearn.html>mathematically rigorous universal AI</A> and <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedelmachine.html>optimal universal problem solvers</A>. His <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/creativity.html>formal theory of creativity &amp; curiosity &amp; fun</A> explains art, science, music, and humor. He also <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/kolmogorov.html>generalized algorithmic information theory</A> and the <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html>many-worlds theory of physics</A>, and introduced the concept of Low-Complexity Art, the information age's extreme form of minimal art. Since 2009 he has been member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. He has published <A HREF=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/onlinepub.html>333 peer-reviewed papers</A>, earned seven best paper/best video awards, the 2013 Helmholtz Award of the International Neural Networks Society, and the 2016 IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer Award. He is also president of NNAISENSE, which aims at building the first practical general purpose AI.
